how to track untrack files read here for more insights
https://stackoverflow.com/questions/572549/difference-between-git-add-a-and-git-add

always try to use 
git add -A // flag of -A instead of .
in order to track all the untracked files

git add . stands for all modifications

But if there are files that have been untracked for a while then you have to use 
git add -A

At the bottom line we can use 
git add -A this is better over git add .
